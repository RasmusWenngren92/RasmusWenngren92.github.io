            <p>For the last 10 years I was working as a baker. Most of that time I worked at Valhallabageriet located in Stockholm. I worked my way to the top and was their headbaker for some time and I also helped them open a new bakery located nearby.

              For a few years I had the opportunity to go to the UK and work at a Michelin Star restaurant. I worked my way up to Chef the Patiserie after 2 years, I learnt a lot about responsibilities. Both my own but also for the team that I was working with. It was a harsh enviorment, but I'm glad I did it.

            I have a lovely wife and two beautiful daughters. I love spending time with my family, we reacently accuiered a summer house where we tend to spend as much time as possible. Family have tought me a lot about myself, who I am who I want to be. And how to priorotise. Many people seems to put work first, witch was the case for me for a long time. But after having kids I realised that there more to this life then working.

          So how did I end up behind a computer? Well, bakery is fun, but not something that's suitable when having two small kids. My goal is to become a great developer and to be able to have a more flexible work, and a better pay. So that in the end I can spend time with the people that mean the most to me.
